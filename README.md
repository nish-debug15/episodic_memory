### Episodic Memory Module

A lightweight Python module that simulates **episodic memory** for AI systems.
It stores short, time aware interactions (events), retrieves relevant past episodes, and helps maintain contextual continuity across conversations or tasks.

Built to be simple, extensible, and easy to plug into larger memory or cognition pipelines.
